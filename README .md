### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: Golden Years Glow: Navigating Retirement Happiness in the HappyDB Saga 
+ This project is conducted by Miao Zhang

+ Project summary: 
In this study, we aim to explore the factors that contribute to the happiness of elderly individuals during their retirement years. Retirement is a significant life transition, often accompanied by various challenges and opportunities. Understanding the sources of joy during this period can provide valuable insights into the well-being of retired individuals and offer guidance on fostering a happier retirement.

+ Three questions will be answered in this report are:
  1. What Makes the Elderly Happy During Their Retirement Period?
  2. Does the contribution to happiness for the elderly vary by region?
  3. Do Grandma and Grandpa Differ in Happiness?
